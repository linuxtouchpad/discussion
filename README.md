# Linux Touchpad Discussions

Welcome!

If you're looking for a developer community forum that touches on all layers of the Linux touchpad stack, you've found it!

Join the [discussion here](https://github.com/linuxtouchpad/discussion/discussions)

## Why?

After discussion with several of the key people in the Linux touchpad software development community, it became clear that there was no central place to discuss improvements to the touchpad user experience except in project-specific issue trackers. This forum fills the gap for developers looking for a high-level place to discuss issues, ask questions, or propose ideas--whether pertinent to the Linux kernel, libinput, Xorg or Wayland.
